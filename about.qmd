# About me 

::: grid
::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-lg-6}

I am a graduate of economics from University of Halle (a small town next to Leipzig, Germany).

Im quite interested in the different aspects of political economy and economic history. This was sparked by my activity with Rethinking Economics, a global network of students who want to change the way economics is thought and practiced. 

On this website I collect various projects and ideas, mostly in a technical / political / economic context. All adorned with a bunch of beautiful Vermeer paintings (like the one on this page, titled ["The Geographer"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Geographer) )

**Newsletters I find interesting and that shaped my thinking:**

##### [Adam Tooze:  Chartbook](https://adamtooze.substack.com/)

##### [Branko Milanovic:  Global Inequality](https://branko2f7.substack.com/)

##### [Financial Times:  Alphaville](https://www.ft.com/alphaville)
