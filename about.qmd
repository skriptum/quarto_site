# marten walk

I am a student of economics in Halle, Germany and quite interested in the different aspects of political economy and economic history. this was especially sparked by my activity with Rethinking Economics, a global network of students who want to change the way economics is thought and practiced. 

This is my personal website, where I collect various projects and ideas, mostly in a technical / political / economic context.
