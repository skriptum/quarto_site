<meta name="description" content="How do asset prices shape the wealth distribution? Motivated by the different trajectories of European housing markets after the financial crisis, this thesis examines how capital gains, particularly in housing, influence wealth inequality in Europe. Drawing on the ECB’s new Distributional Wealth Accounts, the analysis uses panel regressions that exploit cross-country variation in housing markets. The results show that asset prices have first-order consequences on the wealth distribution, driven by differences in portfolio composition across population groups. Rising house prices increase the shares of the middle 40% and especially the bottom 50%, while a booming stock market mainly benefits the top 10%. These effects are robust across specifications but vary substantially across countries, reflecting institutional and portfolio differences. Simulations of alternative price scenarios show that housing booms can slow concentration. However, no country saw house prices grow fast enough to reverse the upward trend in top wealth shares. Together, the results provide detailed insights into the distributional effects of asset prices in Europe, with implications for both monetary and housing policy.">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Distribution of Wealth in Germany, 1895-2018;,citation_abstract=This paper presents the first comprehensive study of the long-run evolution of wealth inequality in Germany. We combine tax data, surveys, national accounts and rich lists to study the distribution of wealth in Germany from 1895 to 2018. We show that the concentration of wealth in the hands of the top 1% has fallen by half,from close to 50% in 1895 to less than 25% today.The interwar period as well as World War II and its aftermath stand out as the great equalizers in 20th century German history.Since unification, two off-setting trends have shaped the German wealth distribution. Households at the top made substantial capital gains from rising equity valuations that were counterbalanced by large middle-class capital gains from rising house prices. Since 1993, wealth of the top 10% and of the middle class(50-90%) approximately doubled in real terms. However, these asset price induced gains in business and housing wealth almost entirely by-passed households in the bottom half of the wealt distribution who do not own these assets. Wealth of the bottom 50% of the population has stagnated since 1993 and their share in total wealth has nearly halved. The wealth gap between households in the bottom and the upper half has widened significantly. In 1993, households in the top 10% were about 50 times richer than households in the bottom half. Today, they are 100 times richer. Finally,we also show that official statistics underestimate privately held German business wealth and real estate wealth.;,citation_author=Thilo N. H.

We observe rising top income and wealth shares in nearly all countries in recent decades. But the magnitude of the increase varies substantially, thereby suggesting that different country-specific policies and institutions matter considerably.

By combining new sources with existing accounts, we estimate the wealth of both private and government sectors and use a new asset-specific decomposition of the long-run accumulation of wealth. We find that, during the twentieth century, the national wealth-to-income ratio remained within a relatively narrow range—between 400% and 600%—until the housing boom of the early 2000s led to an unprecedented rise to 800% in 2007.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Pareto and the Upper Tail of the Income Distribution in the UK: 1799 to the Present;,citation_abstract=The Pareto distribution has long been a source of fascination to economists, and the Pareto coefficient is widely used, in theoretical and empirical studies, as a summary of the degree of concentration of top incomes. This paper examines the empirical evidence from income tax data concerning top incomes in the UK, contrasting the dramatic changes that took place in the twentieth century, after 1918, with the much more modest changes in the preceding nineteenth century. Probing beneath the surface, the paper identifies a number of features of the evolution of the UK income inequality that warrant closer attention. These include the changing shape of the upper tail, where there is a link with Pareto’s theory of elites, the need for a richer functional form to describe top incomes, and the limited evidence at the top of the distribution for a Kuznets curve in nineteenth century Britain.;,citation_author=A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=International Dimensions of Housing Markets;,citation_abstract=We make the case that an international perspective on housing markets can help us understand why house prices and transactions volumes sometimes vary in ways that cannot easily be attributed to local economic factors. We first document cross-country and cross-time variation in house price-to-income ratios, and selectively discuss a growing literature which quantifies how international capital flows affect domestic housing markets. While this literature helps rationalize some of the rhetoric on globalization’s effects on housing markets, it seems difficult at first glance to attribute price variation at the aggregate housing market level to the relatively small absolute magnitudes of cross-border housing capital flows. We argue using a search and matching framework that housing market frictions can magnify the effect of seemingly modest shocks and lead to more widespread reverberation through the housing market, linking local outcomes to the global distributions of wealth, risk, and productivity.;,citation_author=Cristian Badarinza;,citation_author=Tarun Ramadorai;,citation_publication_date=2025-08;,citation_cover_date=2025-08;,citation_year=2025;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1257/jep.20241429;,citation_issn=0895-3309;,citation_volume=39;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Economic Perspectives;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Die Bedeutung von Mieteinkommen und Immobilien für die Ungleichheit in Deutschland;,citation_abstract=Immobilien haben an Bedeutung für die Einkommensungleichheit in Deutschland gewonnen. Der Anteil von Haushalten mit Einkommen aus Vermietung und Verpachtung hat zwischen 2002 und 2017 zugenommen. Mieteinkommen erklären einen wachsenden Anteil der Einkommensungleichheit in Deutschland. Veränderungen der Vermögensungleichheit werden hauptsächlich durch Kapitalgewinne aus Wohnungs- und Aktienkursen sowie durch unterschiedliche Sparquoten verursacht. Steigende Hauspreise verringern tendenziell die Vermögensungleichheit, während steigende Aktienpreise die Vermögensungleichheit vergrößern. In den 2010er Jahren hat der Anteil des Wohneigentums in den deutschen Bundesländern und über die verschiedenen Regionen hinweg zugenommen, insbesondere in städtischen Gebieten und größeren Kommunen. Somit profitierte ein steigender Anteil der deutschen Haushalte von steigenden Hauspreisen, und die Vermögensungleichheit hat sich zwischen 2002 und 2017 nicht wesentlich verändert. Wir dokumentieren erhebliche Unterschiede in Wohneigentum und -vermögen zwischen Ost- und Westdeutschland. Während in Westdeutschland 2017 etwa die Hälfte aller Haushalte in Immobilien investiert ist, liegt dieser Anteil in Ostdeutschland unter 40%. Im Jahr 2017 weisen die Haushalte in Bayern und Hamburg mit durchschnittlich mehr als 350.000 Euro das höchste Nettoimmobilienvermögen auf.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Navigating the housing channel of monetary policy across euro area regions;,citation_abstract=This paper assesses the role of the housing market in the transmission of monetary policy across euro area regions. By exploiting a novel regional dataset on housing-related variables, a structural panel VAR analysis shows that conventional and unconventional monetary policy shocks propagate effectively to the economy, particularly to the housing sector, albeit in a heterogeneous fashion across regions. A formal econometric analysis relates this heterogeneous impact of monetary policy to housing-related long-run regional economic and institutional characteristics. The analysis indicates a prominent role for the housing channel in the transmission of monetary policy to the economy, via both housing wealth and balance sheet effects. Moreover, heterogeneity in institutional features (share of fixed-rate mortgages) and labour income help explain the transmission of monetary policy across regions.;,citation_author=Niccolò Battistini;,citation_author=Matteo Falagiarda;,citation_author=Angelina Hackmann;,citation_author=Moreno Roma;,citation_publication_date=2025-01;,citation_cover_date=2025-01;,citation_year=2025;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.euroecorev.2024.104897;,citation_issn=0014-2921;,citation_volume=171;,citation_journal_title=European Economic Review;">

In this article, we use panel survey data from Britain and Germany to compare how family life course careers and parental socioeconomic background influence young adults’ initial entry into homeownership in these two divergent national contexts. The results show that in Britain, first-time homeownership transitions are tightly synchronized with partnership formation. By contrast, in Germany first moves into homeownership typically occur later around or after the arrival of children. Parental owner-occupation accelerates entry into homeownership in both contexts, while the effects of other parental characteristics are relatively muted. Furthermore, the results highlight how individual socioeconomic factors are critical determinants of entering owner-occupation. This is particularly true in Britain where there is a strong socioeconomic gradient in first-time homeownership transitions.;,citation_author=Sait Bayrakdar;,citation_author=Rory Coulter;,citation_author=Philipp Lersch;,citation_author=Sergi Vidal;,citation_publication_date=2019-07;,citation_cover_date=2019-07;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.1080/02673037.2018.1509949;,citation_issn=0267-3037;,citation_volume=34;,citation_journal_title=Housing Studies;,citation_publisher=Routledge;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=International house prices and macroeconomic fluctuations;,citation_abstract=The paper investigates linkages between general macroeconomic conditions and the housing market for the G-7 area. Among the key results of the paper, we find that the US are an important source of global fluctuations not only for real activity, nominal variables and stock prices, but also for real housing prices. Secondly, albeit distinct driving forces for real activity and financial factors can be pointed out, sizeable global interactions are also evident. In particular, global supply-side shocks are an important determinant of G-7 house prices fluctuations. The linkage between real housing prices and macroeconomic developments is however bidirectional, with investment showing in general a stronger reaction than consumption and output to housing price shocks.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=ECB asset purchases may affect wealth distribution;,citation_abstract=In the debate on monetary policy decisions, to date, little attention has been paid to distributional effects. One reason for this is that they are not included in the mandate of the European Central Bank (ECB). Given the loose monetary policy stance in the euro area and the large-scale program to purchase government and corporate bonds launched in January 2015, the question increasingly being asked is whether any distributional effects can be ignored any longer. The present report looks at the channels of monetary policy that are potentially relevant to distribution and conducts an initial assessment of their relevance to asset purchases in the euro area. The asset purchase program has probably led to rising asset prices, thereby mainly benefitting households at the upper end of the wealth distribution. This is likely to lead to a direct increase in wealth inequality. Whether or not this increase can be at least partially offset in the long term is uncertain. Indebted and/or low-income households could benefit if the program contributes successfully to economic recovery and higher inflation, and therefore helps to improve employment opportunities. So far, the overall distributional effect is therefore unclear. A more in-depth analysis is required in the future.;,citation_author=Kerstin Bernoth;,citation_author=Philipp König;,citation_author=Benjamin Beckers;,citation_publication_date=2016;,citation_cover_date=2016;,citation_year=2016;,citation_issue=7;,citation_issn=2192-7219;,citation_volume=6;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=DIW Economic Bulletin;,citation_publisher=Berlin: Deutsches Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung (DIW);">

We then present an alternative analysis for which we introduce a convenient graphical representation of the wealth distribution.

We develop a harmonized methodology, using machine learning, nonlinear survey calibration and extreme value theory, in order to produce homogeneous pre-tax and post-tax income inequality estimates, comparable across countries and consistent with official national income growth rates. Inequalities have increased in a majority of European countries, both at the top and at the bottom of the distribution, especially between 1980 and 2000. The European top 1% grew more than two times faster than the bottom 50% and captured 17% of regional income growth. Relative poverty in Europe went through ups and downs, increasing from 20% in 1980 to 22% in 2017. Inequalities yet remain lower and have increased much less in Europe than in the US, despite the persistence of strong income differences between European countries and the weaker progressivity of European-wide income redistribution.;,citation_author=Thomas Blanchet;,citation_author=Lucas Chancel;,citation_author=Amory Gethin;,citation_publication_date=2019-04;,citation_cover_date=2019-04;,citation_year=2019;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_technical_report_institution=World Inequality Lab;,citation_technical_report_number=2019/06;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Does housing capital contribute to inequality? A comment on Thomas Piketty’s Capital in the 21st Century;,citation_abstract=In his book, Capital in the 21st Century,Thomas Piketty highlights the risk of an explosion of wealth inequality because capital is accumulating faster than income in several countries including the US and European countries such as France. Our work challenges the conclusions of the author in three steps. First, the author’s result is based on the rise of only one of the components of capital, namely housing capital,and due to housing prices. In fact, housing prices have risen faster than rent and income in many countries.It is worth noting that “productive” capital, excluding housing, has only risen weakly relative to income over the last few decades. Over the longer run, the “productive” capital/income ratio has not increased at all. Second, rent, not housing prices, should matter for the dynamics of wealth inequality, because rent represents both the actual income of housing capital for landlords and the dwelling costs saved by “owner-occupiers” (people living in their own houses). Logically, to properly measure capital, the value of housing capital must be corrected by measuring it on actual rental price, and not housing prices. Third, when we apply this change, we find that the capital/income ratio is actually stable or only mildly higher in the countries analyzed (France, the US, the UK, and Canada) except for Germany where it rose. These conclusions are exactly opposite to those found by Thomas Piketty. However, this does not mean that housing prices do not contribute to other forms of inequality. When housing prices rise, owners of the housing capital hold a higher value that can be transformed into consumption. It is also more difficult for young adults to become homeowners. Housing incomes of owners however do not necessarily increase which casts serious doubt on Piketty’s conclusion of a potential explosive dynamics of inequality based on these trends.;,citation_author=Odran Bonnet;,citation_author=Pierre-Henri Bono;,citation_author=Guillaume Flamerie de La Chapelle;,citation_author=Etienne Wasmer;,citation_publication_date=2014-04;,citation_cover_date=2014-04;,citation_year=2014;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_technical_report_institution=SciencePo;,citation_technical_report_number=2014-07;">

According to Insee’s Housing surveys, 32% of young low-income households were homeowners in 1973, as compared to only 16% in 2013. Beyond the role of macroeconomic and institutional factors (real estate prices, interest rates, term of loans granted, etc.), a decomposition of changes in ownership rates over the period using the “Oaxaca-Blinder” method highlights the role of changes in family structures (increasing proportion of single-parent families, decline in the share of couples with children in the most modest households) and the sharp decline in small rural home ownership. Family support – gift assistance, inheritance and other forms of aid – also played an important part in the 2000s: four out of ten recent homeowners benefited from it, two out of ten even receiving direct financial assistance for their purchase. This support increased significantly among wealthier households during the 2000s, contributing to a widening gap with the share of homeowners in the least well-off populations.;,citation_author=Carole Bonnet;,citation_author=Bertrand Garbinti;,citation_author=Sebastien Grobon;,citation_publication_date=2019-03;,citation_cover_date=2019-03;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=711;,citation_doi=10.2139/ssrn.3352361;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Banque de France Working Paper;">

Especially dependencies among assets have not been captured adequately.

What is the weight of housing in households’ balance sheets and how does this vary across socio-economic groups? ii) What is the incidence of mortgage debt across households and how does this vary across socio-economic groups?

Another important issue is whether housing-related policies raise potential trade-offs between equity, or inequality reduction, and other policy objectives such as employment and productivity growth as well as macroeconomic resilience.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Tax treatment of owner occupied housing and wealth inequality;,citation_abstract=We construct a quantitative general equilibrium lifecycle model with housing tenure decisions to investigate the degree to which wealth inequality in the United States is affected by the preferential tax treatment of home-ownership. Favorable tax treatment of owner occupied housing in the form of home mortgage interest and property tax deductibility, and the untaxed nature of imputed rents, provides a financial incentive for home-ownership over renting as well as an incentive to “over-consume” housing since houses are not fungible. Since the favorable tax treatment of housing disproportionately creates tax savings for the upper quantiles of the income distribution, we quantify how it contributes to the heavily right skewed distribution of wealth in the United States using data from the Survey of Consumer Finances. We consider a revenue-neutral government response to the counter factual experiments of removing the current tax structure on housing. Our quantitative analysis shows that, in terms of distributional effects, removing all of the preferential tax treatments results in an aggregate increase in welfare. However, we do not find any reduction in inequality. We also find that while some re-allocation toward financial assets occurs, households primarily increase their consumption when imputed housing rents are taxed and the property tax deduction is removed. Thus housing tax policy may be effective at encouraging more overall saving through housing assets.;,citation_author=Sang-Wook (Stanley) Cho;,citation_author=Johanna L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Unobserved heterogeneity in panel time series models;,citation_abstract=Recently, the large T panel literature has emphasized unobserved, time-varying heterogeneity that may stem from omitted common variables or global shocks that affect each individual unit differently. These latent common factors induce cross-section dependence and may lead to inconsistent regression coefficient estimates if they are correlated with the explanatory variables. Moreover, if the process underlying these factors is nonstationary, the individual regressions will be spurious but pooling or averaging across individual estimates still permits consistent estimation of a long-run coefficient. The need to tackle both error cross-section dependence and persistent autocorrelation is motivated by the evidence of their pervasiveness found in three well-known, international finance and macroeconomic examples. A range of estimators is surveyed and their finite-sample properties are examined by means of Monte Carlo experiments. These reveal that a mean group version of the common-correlated-effects estimator stands out as the most robust since it is the preferred choice in rather general (non) stationary settings where regressors and errors share common factors and their factor loadings are possibly dependent. Other approaches which perform reasonably well include the two-way fixed effects, demeaned mean group and between estimators but they are less efficient than the common-correlated-effects estimator.;,citation_author=Jerry Coakley;,citation_author=Ana-María Fuertes;,citation_author=Ron Smith;,citation_publication_date=2006-05;,citation_cover_date=2006-05;,citation_year=2006;,citation_issue=9;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.csda.2004.12.015;,citation_issn=0167-9473;,citation_volume=50;,citation_journal_title=Computational Statistics &amp;amp;amp; Data Analysis;,citation_series_title=Statistical signal extraction and filtering;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Heterogeneity and Persistence in Returns to Wealth;,citation_abstract=We provide a systematic analysis of the properties of individual returns to wealth using 12 years of population data from Norway’s administrative tax records. We document a number of novel results. First, individuals earn markedly different average returns on their net worth (a standard deviation of 22.1%) and on its components. Second, heterogeneity in returns does not arise merely from differences in the allocation of wealth between safe and risky assets: returns are heterogeneous even within narrow asset classes. Third, returns are positively correlated with wealth: moving from the 10th to the 90th percentile of the net worth distribution increases the return by 18 percentage points (and 10 percentage points if looking at net-of-tax returns). Fourth, individual wealth returns exhibit substantial persistence over time. We argue that while this persistence partly arises from stable differences in risk exposure and assets scale, it also reflects heterogeneity in sophistication and financial information, as well as entrepreneurial talent. Finally, wealth returns are correlated across generations. We discuss the implications of these findings for several strands of the wealth inequality debate.;,citation_author=Andreas Fagereng;,citation_author=Luigi Guiso;,citation_author=Davide Malacrino;,citation_author=Luigi Pistaferri;,citation_publication_date=2020;,citation_cover_date=2020;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.3982/ECTA14835;,citation_issn=1468-0262;,citation_volume=88;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Econometrica;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Net wealth across the euro area - why household structure matters and how to control for it;,citation_abstract=We study the link between household structure and cross country differences in the wealth distribution using a recently compiled data set for the euro area (HFCS). We estimate counterfactual distributions using non-parametric re-weighting to examine the extent to which differences in the unconditional distributions of wealth across euro area countries can be explained by differences in household structure. We find that imposing a common household structure has strong effects on both the full unconditional distributions as well as its mappings to different inequality measures. For the median 50% of the differences are explained for Austria, 15% for Germany, 25% for Italy, 14% for Spain and 38% for Malta. For others as Belgium, France, Greece, Luxembourg, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia household structure masks the differences to the euro area median and Finland and the Netherlands change their position from below to above the euro area median. The impact on the mean and percentile ratios is similarly strong and varies with regard to direction and level across countries and their distributions. We can confirm the finding of Bover (2010) that the effect on the Gini is somewhat less pronounced, but might mask relevant information by being a net effect of different accumulated effects along the distribution. Country rankings based on almost all of these measures are severely affected alluding to the need for cautious interpretation when dealing with such rankings. Furthermore, the explanatory power of household structure changes along the net wealth distribution. Therefore we argue for more flexible controls for household structure. We provide such a set of controls to account for household type fixed effects which are based on the number of household members as well as possible combinations of age categories and gender.;,citation_author=Pirmin Fessler;,citation_author=Peter Lindner;,citation_author=Esther Segalla;,citation_publication_date=2014;,citation_cover_date=2014;,citation_year=2014;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_technical_report_institution=European Central Bank (ECB);,citation_technical_report_number=1663;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Housing prices and wealth inequality in Western Europe;,citation_abstract=Comparative political economy (CPE) has robustly examined the political and institutional determinants of income inequality. However, the study of wealth, which is more unequally distributed than income, has been largely understudied within CPE. Using new data from the World Income Database (WID), this article examines how economic, political and institutional dynamics shape wealth-to-income ratios within Western European and OECD countries. It is found that the political and institutional determinants that affect income inequality have no short- or long-run effects on the wealth-to-income ratio. Rather, the rise in wealth-to-income ratios is driven by rising housing prices, as well as price changes in other financial assets, not home ownership or national saving rates.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Accounting for Wealth-Inequality Dynamics: Methods, Estimates, and Simulations for France;,citation_abstract=Measuring and understanding the evolution of wealth inequality is a key challenge for researchers, policy makers, and the general public. This paper breaks new ground on this topic by presenting a new method to estimate and study wealth inequality. This method combines fiscal data with household surveys and national accounts in order to provide annual wealth distribution series, with detailed breakdowns by percentiles, age, and assets. Using the case of France as an illustration, we show that the resulting series can be used to better analyze the evolution and the determinants of wealth-inequality dynamics over the 1970–2014 period. We show that the decline in wealth inequality ends in the early 1980s, marking the beginning of a rise in the top 1% wealth share, though with significant fluctuations due largely to asset price movements. Rising inequality in savings rates coupled with highly stratified rates of returns has led to rising wealth concentration in spite of the opposing effect of house price increases. We develop a simple simulation model highlighting how changes in the combination of unequal savings rates, rates of return, and labor earnings that occurred in the early 1980s generated large multiplicative effects that led to radically different steady-state levels of wealth inequality. Taking advantage of the joint distribution of income and wealth, we show that top wealth holders are almost exclusively top capital earners, and increasingly fewer are made up of top labor earners; it has become increasingly difficult in recent decades to access top wealth groups with one’s labor income only.;,citation_author=Bertrand Garbinti;,citation_author=Jonathan Goupille-Lebret;,citation_author=Thomas Piketty;,citation_publication_date=2021-02;,citation_cover_date=2021-02;,citation_year=2021;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1093/jeea/jvaa025;,citation_issn=1542-4766;,citation_volume=19;,citation_journal_title=Journal of the European Economic Association;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Absolute income inequality and rising house prices;,citation_abstract=Income inequality and house prices have risen sharply in developed countries during 1975–2010. In line with theoretical models, we argue that this co-movement is no coincidence, but that inequality has driven up house prices on the grounds that it raises the aggregate demand for housing. Our results suggest that absolute inequality and house prices in most Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries were positively correlated and cointegrated, whereas relative inequality and mean income were not significant long-run determinants. This finding indicates that the surge in OECD house prices in part can be explained by a top-income-induced increase in housing demand, and that it is important to consider the interaction of rising mean income and its relative distribution when studying potential correlates of house prices. Moreover, our results confirm previous findings that the short-term real interest rate also is an important correlate of house prices.;,citation_author=Thomas Goda;,citation_author=Chris Stewart;,citation_author=Alejandro Torres García;,citation_publication_date=2020-10;,citation_cover_date=2020-10;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1093/ser/mwz028;,citation_issn=1475-1461;,citation_volume=18;,citation_journal_title=Socio-Economic Review;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Housing affordability and poverty in Europe: On the deteriorating position of market renters;,citation_abstract=There are growing concerns about housing affordability throughout Europe. Recent studies by Housing Europe and the OECD have suggested that we are witnessing a generalised deterioration in housing affordability, while other studies point to worsening housing affordability for specific groups, such as renters or low-income households. The aim of this paper is to explore trends in, and incidences and determinants of, housing affordability in a comparative European context over the period 2010 to 2018. To do this we analyse data from the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions survey. We examine trends across different measures of housing affordability; examine its association with a variety of socio-economic characteristics and explore country-level differences in housing affordability problems. Our study finds that despite claims of worsening housing affordability, affordability measures show little sign of generalised deterioration over the period in question but that risks of affordability problems have become more concentrated on market renters during this period. At the country level, we find that gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and the at-risk-of-poverty rate are associated with housing affordability problems both between countries as well as within countries over time, while housing allowance coverage and rent regulation stringency are associated with affordability problems between countries.;,citation_author=Rod Hick;,citation_author=Marco Pomati;,citation_author=Mark Stephens;,citation_publication_date=2024-01;,citation_cover_date=2024-01;,citation_year=2024;,citation_doi=10.1017/S0047279423000703;,citation_issn=0047-2794, 1469-7823;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Social Policy;">

We build a life-cycle model with uninsurable income and housing risks and endogenous homeownership in order to quantify the policy impact on homeownership and welfare. Adjusting all three policies has a strong impact on housing tenure choices, closing the gap in homeownership rates between Germany and the United States by about two thirds. At the same time, household welfare would be reduced by moving to a policy regime with low transfer taxes, but it would improve in the absence of social housing, in particular, when coupled with housing subsidies for low-income households.;,citation_author=Leo Kaas;,citation_author=Georgi Kocharkov;,citation_author=Edgar Preugschat;,citation_author=Nawid Siassi;,citation_publication_date=2021-02;,citation_cover_date=2021-02;,citation_year=2021;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1093/jeea/jvaa004;,citation_issn=1542-4766;,citation_volume=19;,citation_journal_title=Journal of the European Economic Association;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Wealth Inequality and Homeownership in Europe;,citation_abstract=The recently published Household Finance and Consumption Survey has revealed large differences in wealth inequality between the countries of the Euro area. We document a strong negative correlation between wealth inequality and homeownership rates across countries.

Furthermore, by decomposing the Gini coefficient across owners and renters we argue that the negative relationship is mostly driven by large inequality between the two groups. We also find that the cross-country differences in the homeownership rate and its negative correlation with wealth inequality are to a large extent driven by households in the lower half of the wealth distribution. Thus, not only the top percentiles but also the lower tail is important in accounting for overall wealth inequality.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Deriving household indebtedness indicators by linking micro and macro balance sheet data;,citation_abstract=Since 2008, when the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis triggered the financial crisis, financial stability analysis has been increasingly interested in the leverage and indebtedness of households along with the vulnerability of different household groups. The reason for this interest is that the household balance sheet and thus, also their risks, are typically counterparts of those of financial institutions. Moreover, several reports, for example the IMF/FSB report to the G-20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors concerning data gaps, emphasise the need for household data which is broken down by different household types. However, none of the reports specify how, in practice, the accounts should be used. This article uses the micro-macro linkage of wealth and income accounts and thus creates a set of macroeconomic wealth accounts broken down by household groups, using micro data available at the national level. The aim of the project is to derive a framework where indebtedness indicators can be optimally estimated in a timely manner and at a quarterly frequency.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Rental Markets and Wealth Inequality in the Euro-Area;,citation_abstract=In this paper we argue that a country’s level of wealth inequality can be viewed as a reflection of the quality of its housing rental market. Using the ECB’s Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS), we document that the aggregate homeownership rate and various measures of wealth inequality are negatively correlated across Euro Area countries. Empirically, this relationship is driven by the fact that in countries with lower homeownership rates a larger fraction of households only hold very low amounts of wealth. We show that a simple wedge in the rental market can explain the qualitative features of the data using a generalequilibrium life-cycle model of household investment and consumption. A larger wedge incentivizes households to save more at a young age in order to make a downpayment and buy a house. This leads not only to a higher homeownership rate but also overall fewer households with low wealth, decreasing crosssectional wealth inequality. Quantitatively, our model explains 54% of the variation in wealth inequality seen in the data. We show that the welfare losses associated with the rental market wedges identified by our model can be substantial.;,citation_author=Fabian Kindermann;,citation_author=Sebastian Kohls;,citation_language=en-US;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=No Price Like Home: Global House Prices, 1870–2012;,citation_abstract=How have house prices evolved over the long run? This paper presents annual house prices for 14 advanced economies since 1870. We show that real house prices stayed constant from the nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century, but rose strongly and with substantial cross-country variation in the second half of the twentieth century. Land prices, not replacement costs, are the key to understanding the trajectory of house prices.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Income and Wealth Inequality in America, 1949–2016;,citation_abstract=This paper introduces a new long-run data set based on archival data from historical waves of the Survey of Consumer Finances. Studying the joint distribution of household income and wealth, we expose the central importance of portfolio composition and asset prices for wealth dynamics in postwar America. Asset prices shift the wealth distribution because of systematic differences in household portfolios along the wealth distribution. Middle-class portfolios are dominated by housing, while rich households predominantly own business equity. Differential changes in equity and house prices shaped wealth dynamics in postwar America and decoupled the income and wealth distribution over extended periods.;,citation_author=Moritz Kuhn;,citation_author=Moritz Schularick;,citation_author=Ulrike I.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=House Price Cycles, Wealth Inequality and Portfolio Reshuffling;,citation_abstract=This paper studies the determinants of wealth inequality dynamics during housing booms and busts. I examine two episodes over the last four decades in Spain by combining fiscal data with household surveys and national accounts to reconstruct the entire wealth distribution. I then develop a new asset-specific decomposition of wealth accumulation that makes it possible to disentangle the importance of differences in rates of return, savings, labor incomes and portfolio choices across wealth groups in explaining wealth inequality dynamics. My analysis documents that top wealth holders time better the market, saving a larger share on housing during booms and reshuffling their portfolio away from housing towards financial assets at the beginning of busts. Counterfactual simulations show that portfolio reshuffling among top wealth holders is the only channel that contributed to reducing the bottom 50% wealth share during the recent housing bust. Finally, I document that this heterogeneity in portfolio choices is consistent with the existence of large differences in portfolio adjustment frictions across wealth groups, mainly coming through differences in the composition of housing. Taken together, these results reveal that portfolio reshuffling among top wealth holders is an important driver of short to medium term fluctuations of wealth inequality.;,citation_author=Clara Martínez-Toledano;,citation_publication_date=2020-01;,citation_cover_date=2020-01;,citation_year=2020;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_technical_report_institution=World Inequality Lab;,citation_technical_report_number=2020/02;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Panel Time Series;,citation_abstract=This chapter discusses the panel time series methods that address the issues of “long” panels of possibly non-stationary series, usually of macroeconomic nature.

Observations coming from countries of the world, or regions within one country or continent, are more likely than not to be correlated in the cross section either by some spatial process, or the effect of common factors. The chapter further explores two issues due to the time series dimension of “long” panel datasets: nonstationarity and cointegration. Long panels allow to estimate separate regressions for each unit. Hence, it is natural to question the assumption of parameter homogeneity as opposed to various kinds of heterogeneous specifications. The heterogeneous model is usually a generalization of the homogeneous one so that estimating it may allow to test for the validity of the pooling restriction.;,citation_author=Giovanni Millo;,citation_author=Yves Croissant;,citation_publication_date=2018;,citation_cover_date=2018;,citation_year=2018;,citation_doi=10.1002/9781119504641.ch8;,citation_isbn=978-1-119-50464-1;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_inbook_title=Panel Data Econometrics with R;">

Adopting an influence function regression approach, the paper calculates the counterfactual effects of small increases in the share of recipients of different-sized wealth transfers in each country. Results suggest that while a marginal increase in inheritance recipients generally contracts wealth inequality measures—confirming a common finding in the literature that inter-generational transfers tend to reduce relative wealth inequality—an increase in recipients of “large” inheritances has the opposite effect. We determine what “large” means in this context by point-estimating the thresholds above which transfers become disequalising. We find that transfers above the ninety-fifth percentile of the national transfer distribution are generally associated with an increasing effect on wealth inequality. Such thresholds are then put in perspective against the inheritance tax schedules in place in the six countries analyzed. No unique pattern emerges. While the thresholds are very close to tax exemption thresholds in Britain and Germany, they are somewhat higher in France and Spain and they are much lower in Italy and the United States.;,citation_author=Salvatore Morelli;,citation_author=Brian Nolan;,citation_author=Juan C.

Specifically, this article revisits, 35&nbsp;years on and against the onset of financialized capitalism, Jim Kemeny’s seminal thesis on the relationship between homeownership and welfare. Focusing on Australia, as a less considered case in the liberal Anglophone cluster, it traces how the state actively overhauled the local post-war homeownership-welfare dynamic from the late 1970s. The analysis establishes how this refurbishment outdates Kemeny’s thesis by rendering features of the post-war homeownership model ineffective and, more significantly, by fashioning new homeowner subjectivities—namely, the investor subject. By bringing together Foucauldian perspectives (mortgage biopolitics) with Marxian political economy, this state-sensitive account both responds to Kemeny’s unexpected silence on the active hand of the Australian state in structuring its homeownership-welfare dynamic, and contributes to the asset-based welfare critique by emphasizing its post-1980s features and the structural drivers that explain its persistence, despite its unequal wealth and welfare outcomes.;,citation_author=Megan Nethercote;,citation_publication_date=2019-02;,citation_cover_date=2019-02;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1080/02673037.2018.1458292;,citation_issn=0267-3037;,citation_volume=34;,citation_journal_title=Housing Studies;,citation_publisher=Routledge;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Intergenerational wealth transfers and wealth inequality in rich countries: What do we learn from Gini decomposition?;,citation_abstract=The role of intergenerational transfers of wealth via inheritance and gifts inter vivos in the accumulation of household wealth and the generation of wealth inequality has been hotly debated. This paper uses data from household wealth surveys for six rich countries – Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the US – to assess the contribution of intergenerational wealth transfers to wealth inequality using decomposition methods for the Gini coefficient. The results show that transfer wealth is consistently a good deal more unequally distributed than non-transfer wealth and total wealth. Transfer wealth accounts for only about one-tenth of overall wealth inequality for the US compared to one-third for Germany and Italy. This mirrors the importance of transfer wealth in total wealth in each country, with differences in inequality in transfer wealth and its correlation with total wealth having only a modest impact. We find that a marginal percentage increase in all transfers reduces total wealth inequality in Britain, Germany and the US, while it would increase total wealth inequality in France, Italy and Spain.;,citation_author=Brian Nolan;,citation_author=Juan C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Wealth Inequality of Nations;,citation_abstract=Comparative research on income inequality has produced several frameworks to study the institutional determinants of income stratification. In contrast, no such framework and much less empirical evidence exist to explain cross-national differences in wealth inequality. This situation is particularly lamentable as cross-national patterns of inequality in wealth diverge sharply from those in income. We seek to pave the way for new explanations of cross-national differences in wealth inequality by tracing them to the influence of different wealth components. Drawing on the literatures on financialization and housing, we argue that housing equity should be the central building block of the comparative analysis of wealth inequality. Using harmonized data on 15 countries included in the Luxembourg Wealth Study (LWS), we demonstrate a lack of association between national levels of income and wealth inequality and concentration. Using decomposition approaches, we then estimate the degree to which national levels of wealth inequality and concentration relate to cross-national differences in wealth portfolios and the distribution of specific asset components. Considering the role of housing equity, financial assets, non-housing real assets, and non-housing debt, we show that cross-national variation in wealth inequality and concentration is centrally determined by the distribution of housing equity.;,citation_author=Fabian T.

For the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and France, we are able to extend our analysis as far back as 1700. We find in every country a gradual rise‘ of wealth-income ratios in recent decades, from about 200–300% in 1970 to 400–600% in 2010. In effect, today’s ratios appear to be returning to the high values observed in Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (600–700%). This can be explained by a long-run asset price recovery (itself driven by changes in capital policies since the world wars) and by the slowdown of productivity and population growth, in line with the $\beta$=sg Harrod-Domar-Solow formula. That is, for a given net saving rate s = 10%, the long-run wealth-income ratio $\beta$ is about 300% if g = 3% and 600% if g = 1.5%.

Our distributional national accounts capture 100% of national income, allowing us to compute growth rates for each quantile of the income distribution consistent with macroeconomic growth. We estimate the distribution of both pretax and posttax income, making it possible to provide a comprehensive view of how government redistribution affects inequality. Average pretax real national income per adult has increased 60% from 1980 to 2014, but we find that it has stagnated for the bottom 50% of the distribution at about $16,000 a year. The pretax income of the middle class—adults between the median and the 90th percentile—has grown 40% since 1980, faster than what tax and survey data suggest, due in particular to the rise of tax-exempt fringe benefits. Income has boomed at the top. The upsurge of top incomes was first a labor income phenomenon but has mostly been a capital income phenomenon since 2000. The government has offset only a small fraction of the increase in inequality. The reduction of the gender gap in earnings has mitigated the increase in inequality among adults, but the share of women falls steeply as one moves up the labor income distribution, and is only 11% in the top 0.1% in 2014.;,citation_author=Thomas Piketty;,citation_author=Emmanuel Saez;,citation_author=Gabriel Zucman;,citation_publication_date=2018-05;,citation_cover_date=2018-05;,citation_year=2018;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1093/qje/qjx043;,citation_issn=0033-5533;,citation_volume=133;,citation_journal_title=The Quarterly Journal of Economics;">

We estimate wealth by capitalizing the incomes reported by individual taxpayers, accounting for assets that do not generate taxable income. We successfully test our capitalization method in three micro datasets where we can observe both income and wealth: the Survey of Consumer Finance, linked estate and income tax returns, and foundations’ tax records. We find that wealth concentration was high in the beginning of the twentieth century, fell from 1929 to 1978, and has continuously increased since then. The top 0.1% wealth share has risen from 7% in 1978 to 22% in 2012, a level almost as high as in 1929. Top wealth-holders are younger today than in the 1960s and earn a higher fraction of the economy’s labor income. The bottom 90% wealth share first increased up to the mid-1980s and then steadily declined. The increase in wealth inequality in recent decades is due to the upsurge of top incomes combined with an increase in saving rate inequality.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=To own or not to own? Household portfolios, demographics and institutions in a cross-national perspective;,citation_abstract=Using harmonized wealth data and a novel decomposition approach, we show that cohort effects exist in the income profiles of asset and debt portfolios for a sample of European countries, the U.S. and Canada. We find that younger households’ participation decisions in assets are more responsive to income than older households. Family structure plays a significant role in explaining cross-country differences for both cohorts. Examining institutional differences, we find that in more financially developed and economically open countries, households are less likely to own housing but more likely to be in debt. Typical mortgage characteristics and mathematical literacy are also correlated with debt participation across countries. These findings have important implications for policy setting during times of financial unease for the young, as well as for the future in helping secure adequate income for the elderly. Our results show that there is scope for policies which promote asset participation for young households and debt participation, where there is a need for consumption smoothing, for older households.;,citation_author=Eva Sierminska;,citation_author=Karina Doorley;,citation_publication_date=2013;,citation_cover_date=2013;,citation_year=2013;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_technical_report_institution=SOEPpapers on Multidisciplinary Panel Data Research;,citation_technical_report_number=611;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The distribution of housing wealth in 16 European countries: Accounting for institutional differences;,citation_abstract=Housing wealth is the largest source of household wealth, but we know little about the distribution of housing wealth and how institutions have shaped this distribution. Subsidies for homeownership, privatisation of social housing and mortgage finance liberalisation are likely to have influenced the distribution of housing wealth in recent decades. To examine their impact, we describe housing wealth inequalities across occupational classes for two birth cohorts aged fifty and older. The analysis is conducted across 16 European countries with divergent welfare states and housing systems using the fourth wave of the survey of health, ageing and retirement in Europe (SHARE; 2011/2012). Our results indicate that the expansion of homeownership in a market-based housing system is associated with a more unequal distribution of housing wealth across occupational classes, as an increasing number of “marginal” owners are drawn into precarious homeownership. Such a pattern is not found in housing wealth accumulation regimes with a less market-based provision of housing. When the state or the family drive homeownership expansion, a de-coupling of labour market income and housing consumption results in a more equal distribution of housing wealth.;,citation_author=Barend Wind;,citation_author=Philipp Lersch;,citation_author=Caroline Dewilde;,citation_publication_date=2017-12;,citation_cover_date=2017-12;,citation_year=2017;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1007/s10901-016-9540-3;,citation_issn=1573-7772;,citation_volume=32;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Housing and the Built Environment;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=In which European countries is homeownership more financially advantageous? Explaining the size of the tenure wealth gap in 10 countries with different housing and welfare regimes;,citation_abstract=Previous research consistently shows that homeowners accumulate more wealth compared with tenants. In this paper, we describe the size of this “tenure wealth gap” for 10 European countries. Furthermore, we explain why the size of the tenure wealth gap differs between countries by including cross-level interactions between institutional variables and housing tenure in a series of country-fixed effects regression models. Cross-country differences arise as the costs of owning versus renting, as well as the profitability of homeownership versus other investments, differ along the lines of welfare policies and housing regime arrangements. We attempt to control for selection bias related to tenure status by using propensity score matching techniques, using data from the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS). Our findings suggest that the tenure wealth gap is largest in familialistic welfare states, in which marginalised tenants are unable to save, whereas homeownership is a family resource that provides an in-kind retirement income (“passive” asset-based welfare). We find smaller tenure wealth gaps in countries with a financialised promotion of homeownership, where housing wealth functions as a privatised welfare arrangement (“active” asset-based welfare). The smallest tenure wealth gaps occur in countries with more affordable rental housing, allowing tenants to accumulate savings.;,citation_author=Barend Wind;,citation_author=Caroline Dewilde;,citation_publication_date=2019-10;,citation_cover_date=2019-10;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1080/19491247.2019.1608113;,citation_issn=1949-1247;,citation_volume=19;,citation_journal_title=International Journal of Housing Policy;,citation_publisher=Routledge;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Heterogenous Rates of Return on Homes: Do The Rich Do Better?;,citation_abstract=Recent work on wealth inequality using the capitalization method wherein aggregate wealth totals are distributed proportionately to property income like dividends motivates concern about whether rates of return on assets vary across the income or wealth distribution. Here I use accrued capital gains and imputed rent on homes estimated from the Survey of Consumer Finances to address this issue. Both capital gains and imputed rent form part of total income. I find strong econometric evidence that returns vary directly with wealth level and are considerably higher for very wealthy compared to poorer households. However, I do not find evidence that higher income households receive higher returns once controlling for overall market house price trends. Returns are also strongly related to overall market house price movements, suggesting that timing the market is a key determinant. However, paradoxically, adding housing returns to baseline household wealth reduces overall wealth inequality.;,citation_author=Edward N.

Asset prices plunged between 2007 and 2010 but then rebounded from 2010 to 2013. The most telling finding is that median wealth plummeted by 44 percent between 2007 and 2010, almost double the drop in housing prices. Wealth inequality, after almost two decades of little movement, was up sharply from 2007 to 2010. This sharp fall in median net worth and rise in overall wealth inequality are traceable primarily to the high leverage of middle-class families, the high share of homes in their portfolio, and the plunge in house prices. Rather remarkably, median (and mean) wealth did not essentially change from 2010 to 2013 despite the rebound in asset prices. The proximate cause was the high dissavings of the middle class.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Various Versatile Variances: An Object-Oriented Implementation of Clustered Covariances in R;,citation_abstract=Clustered covariances or clustered standard errors are very widely used to account for correlated or clustered data, especially in economics, political sciences, and other social sciences. They are employed to adjust the inference following estimation of a standard least-squares regression or generalized linear model estimated by maximum likelihood. Although many publications just refer to &amp;amp;amp;quot;the&amp;quot; clustered standard errors, there is a surprisingly wide variety of clustered covariances, particularly due to different flavors of bias corrections. Furthermore, while the linear regression model is certainly the most important application case, the same strategies can be employed in more general models (e.g., for zero-inflated, censored, or limited responses). In R, functions for covariances in clustered or panel models have been somewhat scattered or available only for certain modeling functions, notably the (generalized) linear regression model. In contrast, an object-oriented approach to &quot;robust&quot; covariance matrix estimation - applicable beyond lm() and glm() - is available in the sandwich package but has been limited to the case of cross-section or time series data. Starting with sandwich 2.4.0, this shortcoming has been corrected: Based on methods for two generic functions (estfun() and bread()), clustered and panel covariances are provided in vcovCL(), vcovPL(), and vcovPC(). Moreover, clustered bootstrap covariances are provided in vcovBS(), using model update() on bootstrap samples. These are directly applicable to models from packages including MASS, pscl, countreg, and betareg, among many others.

    <p>How do asset prices shape the wealth distribution? Motivated by the different trajectories of European housing markets after the financial crisis, this thesis examines how capital gains, particularly in housing, influence wealth inequality in Europe. Drawing on the ECB’s new Distributional Wealth Accounts, the analysis uses panel regressions that exploit cross-country variation in housing markets. The results show that asset prices have first-order consequences on the wealth distribution, driven by differences in portfolio composition across population groups. Rising house prices increase the shares of the middle 40% and especially the bottom 50%, while a booming stock market mainly benefits the top 10%. These effects are robust across specifications but vary substantially across countries, reflecting institutional and portfolio differences. Simulations of alternative price scenarios show that housing booms can slow concentration. However, no country saw house prices grow fast enough to reverse the upward trend in top wealth shares. Together, the results provide detailed insights into the distributional effects of asset prices in Europe, with implications for both monetary and housing policy.</p>

<p>Housing is Europe’s largest asset. Its value is central to both household finances and the macroeconomy. Yet despite advances in the literature, there is still limited comparative evidence on the distributional consequences of housing wealth accumulation in Europe. This thesis draws on recent improvements in distributional data <span class="citation" data-cites="blatnikIntroducingDistributionalWealth2024">(<a href="#ref-blatnikIntroducingDistributionalWealth2024" role="doc-biblioref">Blatnik et al. 2024</a>)</span> and methodological approaches developed for the United States <span class="citation" data-cites="kuhnIncomeWealthInequality2020">(<a href="#ref-kuhnIncomeWealthInequality2020" role="doc-biblioref">Kuhn, Schularick, and Steins 2020</a>)</span> to examine how the wealth distribution reacts to changes in house prices.</p>
<p>The importance of housing for the modern economy cannot be overstated: houses are the primary item on household balance sheets; mortgages make up the largest share of debt in developed economies <span class="citation" data-cites="jordaGreatMortgagingHousing2016">(<a href="#ref-jordaGreatMortgagingHousing2016" role="doc-biblioref">Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor 2016</a>)</span>; and housing cycles play a central role in macroeconomic fluctuations <span class="citation" data-cites="cesa-bianchiHousingCyclesMacroeconomic2013">(<a href="#ref-cesa-bianchiHousingCyclesMacroeconomic2013" role="doc-biblioref">Cesa-Bianchi 2013</a>)</span>, particularly apparent during and after the financial crisis of 2008.</p>
<p>At the same time, inequality has returned to the forefront of economic debate. Since Piketty’s Capital in the Twenty-First Century <span class="citation" data-cites="pikettyCapitalTwentyFirstCentury2014">(<a href="#ref-pikettyCapitalTwentyFirstCentury2014" role="doc-biblioref">Piketty 2014</a>)</span>, research on the distribution of wealth and income has expanded rapidly, supported by large-scale data initiatives such as WID.world <span class="citation" data-cites="alvaredoGlobalInequalityDynamics2017">(<a href="#ref-alvaredoGlobalInequalityDynamics2017" role="doc-biblioref">Alvaredo et al. 2017</a>)</span> and the creation of official distributional accounts in developed economies <span class="citation" data-cites="battyDistributionalFinancialAccounts2022">(e.g. <a href="#ref-battyDistributionalFinancialAccounts2022" role="doc-biblioref">Batty et al. 2022</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Bringing these two strands together, this thesis investigates how changes in asset prices, particularly housing, affect the distribution of wealth in Europe. Because the composition of household portfolios differs across the population (<a href="#fig-portfolio" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2</a>), identical price movements can have vastly different distributional consequences. While high-wealth households tend to hold more business and financial assets tied to stock market performance, middle- and lower-wealth households primarily own housing and often carry more leverage, making them more exposed to house price movements <span class="citation" data-cites="adamDistributionalConsequencesAsset2016">(<a href="#ref-adamDistributionalConsequencesAsset2016" role="doc-biblioref">Adam and Tzamourani 2016</a>)</span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="data" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data">Data</h3>
<p>This analysis relies on newly released Distributional Wealth Accounts (DWA) from the European Central Bank <span class="citation" data-cites="blatnikIntroducingDistributionalWealth2024">(<a href="#ref-blatnikIntroducingDistributionalWealth2024" role="doc-biblioref">Blatnik et al. 2024</a>)</span>. The DWA combine detailed micro-level survey’s of households balance sheets with data from national accounts, ensuring macro-consistent estimates while preserving detailed information about the distribution of assets. The result is a harmonised, cross-country dataset for the Eurozone that captures changes in the wealth distribution at a much higher frequency than traditional surveys, making it well-suited for analysing the distributional effects of asset price movements.</p>
</section>
<section id="method" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="method">Method</h3>
<p>Building on the regression framework of <span class="citation" data-cites="kuhnIncomeWealthInequality2020">Kuhn, Schularick, and Steins (<a href="#ref-kuhnIncomeWealthInequality2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>, who relate changes in US wealth shares to asset price movements using broad survey data over several decades, this thesis applies a higher-frequency and cross-country approach. Using the quarterly data from the DWA for all euro area countries from 2009–2022, it estimates panel models linking changes in the wealth shares of the bottom 50%, middle 40%, and top 10% respectively to movements in housing and equity prices.</p>
</section>
<section id="results" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="results">Results</h3>
<p>The results demonstrate the central role asset prices play in the evolution of wealth inequality (<a href="#tbl-results" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;1</a>). Rising house prices increase the share of the middle 40% and particularly the bottom 50% at the expense of the top decile. Conversely, increasing stock prices are found to benefit the top 10%, to the detriment of the rest of the population. Notably, these results vary strongly across european countries (<a href="#fig-indiv" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a>), reflecting differences in portfolio structures and institutional settings.</p>
</section>
<section id="simulations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="simulations">Simulations</h3>
<p>To further analyze the effects, counterfactual simulations explore how alternative asset price paths would have affected wealth shares in Europe (<a href="#fig-simulation" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;3</a>). Scenarios with strong housing growth shift wealth away from the top 10% toward the middle and lower segments, while weak or falling house prices have the opposite effect. However, even in the most extreme housing boom observed, these appreciations cannot offset the gains of rising stock prices for the top decile. In no counterfactual scenario does the share of the top 10% decrease over the observed timeframe.</p>
