  abstract = {This paper presents the first comprehensive study of the long-run evolution of wealth inequality in Germany. We combine tax data, surveys, national accounts and rich lists to study the distribution of wealth in Germany from 1895 to 2018. We show that the concentration of wealth in the hands of the top 1\% has fallen by half,from close to 50\% in 1895 to less than 25\% today.The interwar period as well as World War II and its aftermath stand out as the great equalizers in 20th century German history.Since unification, two off-setting trends have shaped the German wealth distribution. Households at the top made substantial capital gains from rising equity valuations that were counterbalanced by large middle-class capital gains from rising house prices. Since 1993, wealth of the top 10\% and of the middle class(50-90\%) approximately doubled in real terms. However, these asset price induced gains in business and housing wealth almost entirely by-passed households in the bottom half of the wealt distribution who do not own these assets. Wealth of the bottom 50\% of the population has stagnated since 1993 and their share in total wealth has nearly halved. The wealth gap between households in the bottom and the upper half has widened significantly. In 1993, households in the top 10\% were about 50 times richer than households in the bottom half. Today, they are 100 times richer. Finally,we also show that official statistics underestimate privately held German business wealth and real estate wealth.},

Probing beneath the surface, the paper identifies a number of features of the evolution of the UK income inequality that warrant closer attention. These include the changing shape of the upper tail, where there is a link with Pareto's theory of elites, the need for a richer functional form to describe top incomes, and the limited evidence at the top of the distribution for a Kuznets curve in nineteenth century Britain.},

We first document cross-country and cross-time variation in house price-to-income ratios, and selectively discuss a growing literature which quantifies how international capital flows affect domestic housing markets. While this literature helps rationalize some of the rhetoric on globalization's effects on housing markets, it seems difficult at first glance to attribute price variation at the aggregate housing market level to the relatively small absolute magnitudes of cross-border housing capital flows. We argue using a search and matching framework that housing market frictions can magnify the effect of seemingly modest shocks and lead to more widespread reverberation through the housing market, linking local outcomes to the global distributions of wealth, risk, and productivity.},

A formal econometric analysis relates this heterogeneous impact of monetary policy to housing-related long-run regional economic and institutional characteristics. The analysis indicates a prominent role for the housing channel in the transmission of monetary policy to the economy, via both housing wealth and balance sheet effects. Moreover, heterogeneity in institutional features (share of fixed-rate mortgages) and labour income help explain the transmission of monetary policy across regions.},

In this article, we use panel survey data from Britain and Germany to compare how family life course careers and parental socioeconomic background influence young adults' initial entry into homeownership in these two divergent national contexts. The results show that in Britain, first-time homeownership transitions are tightly synchronized with partnership formation. By contrast, in Germany first moves into homeownership typically occur later around or after the arrival of children. Parental owner-occupation accelerates entry into homeownership in both contexts, while the effects of other parental characteristics are relatively muted. Furthermore, the results highlight how individual socioeconomic factors are critical determinants of entering owner-occupation. This is particularly true in Britain where there is a strong socioeconomic gradient in first-time homeownership transitions.},

In particular, global supply-side shocks are an important determinant of G-7 house prices fluctuations. The linkage between real housing prices and macroeconomic developments is however bidirectional, with investment showing in general a stronger reaction than consumption and output to housing price shocks.

One reason for this is that they are not included in the mandate of the European Central Bank (ECB). Given the loose monetary policy stance in the euro area and the large-scale program to purchase government and corporate bonds launched in January 2015, the question increasingly being asked is whether any distributional effects can be ignored any longer. The present report looks at the channels of monetary policy that are potentially relevant to distribution and conducts an initial assessment of their relevance to asset purchases in the euro area. The asset purchase program has probably led to rising asset prices, thereby mainly benefitting households at the upper end of the wealth distribution. This is likely to lead to a direct increase in wealth inequality. Whether or not this increase can be at least partially offset in the long term is uncertain. Indebted and/or low-income households could benefit if the program contributes successfully to economic recovery and higher inflation, and therefore helps to improve employment opportunities. So far, the overall distributional effect is therefore unclear. A more in-depth analysis is required in the future.},

We develop a harmonized methodology, using machine learning, nonlinear survey calibration and extreme value theory, in order to produce homogeneous pre-tax and post-tax income inequality estimates, comparable across countries and consistent with official national income growth rates. Inequalities have increased in a majority of European countries, both at the top and at the bottom of the distribution, especially between 1980 and 2000. The European top 1\% grew more than two times faster than the bottom 50\% and captured 17\% of regional income growth. Relative poverty in Europe went through ups and downs, increasing from 20\% in 1980 to 22\% in 2017. Inequalities yet remain lower and have increased much less in Europe than in the US, despite the persistence of strong income differences between European countries and the weaker progressivity of European-wide income redistribution.},

We do so by building the first Distributional Wealth Accounts for Europe, including households' assets, liabilities, investment flows, and the wealth distribution for most European countries from 1970--2020. We find that although aggregate household wealth to income ratios have followed a similar increasing pattern in both Europe and the United States since 1970, wealth concentration has increased much faster in the United States. Using wealth accumulation decompositions and counterfactual simulations, we show that the weaker rise in labor income inequality and the stronger rise in house prices relative to financial assets in Europe versus the United States appear to explain why Europe has experienced a more moderate rise in wealth concentration since the mid-1980s.},

  abstract = {In his book, Capital in the 21st Century,Thomas Piketty highlights the risk of an explosion of wealth inequality because capital is accumulating faster than income in several countries including the US and European countries such as France. Our work challenges the conclusions of the author in three steps. First, the author's result is based on the rise of only one of the components of capital, namely housing capital,and due to housing prices. In fact, housing prices have risen faster than rent and income in many countries.It is worth noting that ``productive'' capital, excluding housing, has only risen weakly relative to income over the last few decades. Over the longer run, the ``productive'' capital/income ratio has not increased at all. Second, rent, not housing prices, should matter for the dynamics of wealth inequality, because rent represents both the actual income of housing capital for landlords and the dwelling costs saved by ``owner-occupiers'' (people living in their own houses). Logically, to properly measure capital, the value of housing capital must be corrected by measuring it on actual rental price, and not housing prices. Third, when we apply this change, we find that the capital/income ratio is actually stable or only mildly higher in the countries analyzed (France, the US, the UK, and Canada) except for Germany where it rose. These conclusions are exactly opposite to those found by Thomas Piketty. However, this does not mean that housing prices do not contribute to other forms of inequality. When housing prices rise, owners of the housing capital hold a higher value that can be transformed into consumption. It is also more difficult for young adults to become homeowners. Housing incomes of owners however do not necessarily increase which casts serious doubt on Piketty's conclusion of a potential explosive dynamics of inequality based on these trends.},

According to Insee's Housing surveys, 32\% of young low-income households were homeowners in 1973, as compared to only 16\% in 2013. Beyond the role of macroeconomic and institutional factors (real estate prices, interest rates, term of loans granted, etc.), a decomposition of changes in ownership rates over the period using the ``Oaxaca-Blinder'' method highlights the role of changes in family structures (increasing proportion of single-parent families, decline in the share of couples with children in the most modest households) and the sharp decline in small rural home ownership. Family support -- gift assistance, inheritance and other forms of aid -- also played an important part in the 2000s: four out of ten recent homeowners benefited from it, two out of ten even receiving direct financial assistance for their purchase. This support increased significantly among wealthier households during the 2000s, contributing to a widening gap with the share of homeowners in the least well-off populations.},

Vine copulas can fill this gap by benefiting from the rich class of existing bivariate parametric copula families. Exploiting this in combination with GARCH models for the margins, we develop a~regular vine copula based factor model for asset returns, the Regular Vine Market Sector model, which is motivated by the classical CAPM and shown to be superior to the CAVA model proposed by~Heinen and Valdesogo (2009). The model can also be used to separate the systematic and idiosyncratic risk of specific stocks, and we explicitly discuss how vine copula models can be employed for active and passive portfolio management. In particular, Value-at-Risk forecasting and asset allocation are treated in detail. All developed models and methods are used to analyze the Euro Stoxx 50 index, a~major market indicator for the Eurozone. Relevant benchmark models such as the popular DCC model and the common Student's t copula are taken into account.},

The analysis addresses several questions: i) How is homeownership and housing tenure distributed across the population along various socio-economic characteristics such as income, wealth and age? What is the weight of housing in households' balance sheets and how does this vary across socio-economic groups? ii) What is the incidence of mortgage debt across households and how does this vary across socio-economic groups? What is the impact of mortgage debt on access to homeownership and wealth accumulation, and on debt overburden and financial risks among vulnerable groups? iii) Is housing a vehicle for wealth accumulation? Can it be a barrier to residential mobility? iv) Is there a link between homeownership and wealth inequality? Between inequality in housing wealth and in total wealth? A key policy issue addressed in this paper is whether and how housing-related policies affect wealth distribution. Another important issue is whether housing-related policies raise potential trade-offs between equity, or inequality reduction, and other policy objectives such as employment and productivity growth as well as macroeconomic resilience. Informed by the stylised facts and existing evidence, this paper discusses preliminary policy implications of housing reform to promote inclusiveness and social mobility, to enhance efficiency in the allocation of labour and capital and to strengthen macroeconomic resilience.},

Favorable tax treatment of owner occupied housing in the form of home mortgage interest and property tax deductibility, and the untaxed nature of imputed rents, provides a financial incentive for home-ownership over renting as well as an incentive to ``over-consume'' housing since houses are not fungible. Since the favorable tax treatment of housing disproportionately creates tax savings for the upper quantiles of the income distribution, we quantify how it contributes to the heavily right skewed distribution of wealth in the United States using data from the Survey of Consumer Finances. We consider a revenue-neutral government response to the counter factual experiments of removing the current tax structure on housing. Our quantitative analysis shows that, in terms of distributional effects, removing all of the preferential tax treatments results in an aggregate increase in welfare. However, we do not find any reduction in inequality. We also find that while some re-allocation toward financial assets occurs, households primarily increase their consumption when imputed housing rents are taxed and the property tax deduction is removed. Thus housing tax policy may be effective at encouraging more overall saving through housing assets.},

These latent common factors induce cross-section dependence and may lead to inconsistent regression coefficient estimates if they are correlated with the explanatory variables. Moreover, if the process underlying these factors is nonstationary, the individual regressions will be spurious but pooling or averaging across individual estimates still permits consistent estimation of a long-run coefficient. The need to tackle both error cross-section dependence and persistent autocorrelation is motivated by the evidence of their pervasiveness found in three well-known, international finance and macroeconomic examples. A range of estimators is surveyed and their finite-sample properties are examined by means of Monte Carlo experiments. These reveal that a mean group version of the common-correlated-effects estimator stands out as the most robust since it is the preferred choice in rather general (non) stationary settings where regressors and errors share common factors and their factor loadings are possibly dependent. Other approaches which perform reasonably well include the two-way fixed effects, demeaned mean group and between estimators but they are less efficient than the common-correlated-effects estimator.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study is to analyse the effect of conventional and unconventional monetary policy shocks on housing price dynamics in Europe (2000--2020). We propose a pan-European comparative analysis at a city market level, contrary to the previous literature.We build a quarterly market dataset for 13 European cities (Paris, Lyon, Marseille, Berlin, Munich, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Madrid, Barcelona, Seville, London, Birmingham and Manchester). We proceed in two steps. First, we develop a structural VAR (vector autoregression) model. Second, we conduct a forecast error variance decomposition analysis.We show that a contractionary policy rate has a negative influence on house prices with relevant differences. A balance sheet shock displays a heterogeneous effect on housing prices. Globally, we observe that a conventional monetary policy shock explains a larger share of total housing price variance than an unconventional monetary policy shock. Finally, our results report that conventional and unconventional monetary policy shocks have a greater impact in more liberalized credit markets.We develop a pan-European analysis of house prices at a market level for a sample of 13 European cities. A parsimonious structural VAR model is used to study the dynamics of conventional and unconventional monetary policies on house prices in major European markets: Paris, Lyon, Marseille, Berlin, Munich, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Madrid, Barcelona, Seville, London, Birmingham and Manchester. Our~results highlighting the relative importance of conventional and unconventional monetary shocks, identify the existence of heterogeneous effects of monetary policies in European city markets.},

We document a number of novel results. First, individuals earn markedly different average returns on their net worth (a standard deviation of 22.1\%) and on its components. Second, heterogeneity in returns does not arise merely from differences in the allocation of wealth between safe and risky assets: returns are heterogeneous even within narrow asset classes. Third, returns are positively correlated with wealth: moving from the 10th to the 90th percentile of the net worth distribution increases the return by 18 percentage points (and 10 percentage points if looking at net-of-tax returns). Fourth, individual wealth returns exhibit substantial persistence over time. We argue that while this persistence partly arises from stable differences in risk exposure and assets scale, it also reflects heterogeneity in sophistication and financial information, as well as entrepreneurial talent. Finally, wealth returns are correlated across generations. We discuss the implications of these findings for several strands of the wealth inequality debate.},

We estimate counterfactual distributions using non-parametric re-weighting to examine the extent to which differences in the unconditional distributions of wealth across euro area countries can be explained by differences in household structure. We find that imposing a common household structure has strong effects on both the full unconditional distributions as well as its mappings to different inequality measures. For the median 50\% of the differences are explained for Austria, 15\% for Germany, 25\% for Italy, 14\% for Spain and 38\% for Malta. For others as Belgium, France, Greece, Luxembourg, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia household structure masks the differences to the euro area median and Finland and the Netherlands change their position from below to above the euro area median. The impact on the mean and percentile ratios is similarly strong and varies with regard to direction and level across countries and their distributions. We can confirm the finding of Bover (2010) that the effect on the Gini is somewhat less pronounced, but might mask relevant information by being a net effect of different accumulated effects along the distribution. Country rankings based on almost all of these measures are severely affected alluding to the need for cautious interpretation when dealing with such rankings. Furthermore, the explanatory power of household structure changes along the net wealth distribution. Therefore we argue for more flexible controls for household structure. We provide such a set of controls to account for household type fixed effects which are based on the number of household members as well as possible combinations of age categories and gender.},

It is found that the political and institutional determinants that affect income inequality have no short- or long-run effects on the wealth-to-income ratio. Rather, the rise in wealth-to-income ratios is driven by rising housing prices, as well as price changes in other financial assets, not home ownership or national saving rates. The article concludes by examining how the changing dynamics of housing prices and wealth inequality will increasingly shape intergenerational -- and associated class-based -- political conflict in Western Europe.},

This paper breaks new ground on this topic by presenting a new method to estimate and study wealth inequality. This method combines fiscal data with household surveys and national accounts in order to provide annual wealth distribution series, with detailed breakdowns by percentiles, age, and assets. Using the case of France as an illustration, we show that the resulting series can be used to better analyze the evolution and the determinants of wealth-inequality dynamics over the 1970--2014 period. We show that the decline in wealth inequality ends in the early 1980s, marking the beginning of a rise in the top 1\% wealth share, though with significant fluctuations due largely to asset price movements. Rising inequality in savings rates coupled with highly stratified rates of returns has led to rising wealth concentration in spite of the opposing effect of house price increases. We develop a simple simulation model highlighting how changes in the combination of unequal savings rates, rates of return, and labor earnings that occurred in the early 1980s generated large multiplicative effects that led to radically different steady-state levels of wealth inequality. Taking advantage of the joint distribution of income and wealth, we show that top wealth holders are almost exclusively top capital earners, and increasingly fewer are made up of top labor earners; it has become increasingly difficult in recent decades to access top wealth groups with one's labor income only.},

In line with theoretical models, we argue that this co-movement is no coincidence, but that inequality has driven up house prices on the grounds that it raises the aggregate demand for housing. Our results suggest that absolute inequality and house prices in most Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries were positively correlated and cointegrated, whereas relative inequality and mean income were not significant long-run determinants. This finding indicates that the surge in OECD house prices in part can be explained by a top-income-induced increase in housing demand, and that it is important to consider the interaction of rising mean income and its relative distribution when studying potential correlates of house prices. Moreover, our results confirm previous findings that the short-term real interest rate also is an important correlate of house prices.},

Controlling for endogeneity, time, and country fixed effects, our results suggest that an increase in income inequality has a significant negative effect on real house prices. This finding is robust to the use of both the Gini coefficient and top income share as measures of income inequality and the use of absolute and relative income inequality measures, as well as a range of other robustness checks. We examine crime as a mechanism through which income inequality influences housing prices and find that the theft rate is a channel via which higher income inequality contributes to lower house prices.},

  abstract = {There are growing concerns about housing affordability throughout Europe. Recent studies by Housing Europe and the OECD have suggested that we are witnessing a generalised deterioration in housing affordability, while other studies point to worsening housing affordability for specific groups, such as renters or low-income households. The aim of this paper is to explore trends in, and incidences and determinants of, housing affordability in a comparative European context over the period 2010 to 2018. To do this we analyse data from the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions survey. We examine trends across different measures of housing affordability; examine its association with a variety of socio-economic characteristics and explore country-level differences in housing affordability problems. Our study finds that despite claims of worsening housing affordability, affordability measures show little sign of generalised deterioration over the period in question but that risks of affordability problems have become more concentrated on market renters during this period. At the country level, we find that gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and the at-risk-of-poverty rate are associated with housing affordability problems both between countries as well as within countries over time, while housing allowance coverage and rent regulation stringency are associated with affordability problems between countries.},

In comparison to other countries with higher homeownership such as the United States, Germany has an extensive social housing sector with broad eligibility criteria, high transfer taxes when buying real estate, and no tax deductions for mortgage interest payments by owner-occupiers. We build a life-cycle model with uninsurable income and housing risks and endogenous homeownership in order to quantify the policy impact on homeownership and welfare. Adjusting all three policies has a strong impact on housing tenure choices, closing the gap in homeownership rates between Germany and the United States by about two thirds. At the same time, household welfare would be reduced by moving to a policy regime with low transfer taxes, but it would improve in the absence of social housing, in particular, when coupled with housing subsidies for low-income households.},

Furthermore, by decomposing the Gini coefficient across owners and renters we argue that the negative relationship is mostly driven by large inequality between the two groups. We also find that the cross-country differences in the homeownership rate and its negative correlation with wealth inequality are to a large extent driven by households in the lower half of the wealth distribution. Thus, not only the top percentiles but also the lower tail is important in accounting for overall wealth inequality. JEL Codes: D31, E21, G11.},

  abstract = {Since 2008, when the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis triggered the financial crisis, financial stability analysis has been increasingly interested in the leverage and indebtedness of households along with the vulnerability of different household groups. The reason for this interest is that the household balance sheet and thus, also their risks, are typically counterparts of those of financial institutions. Moreover, several reports, for example the IMF/FSB report to the G-20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors concerning data gaps, emphasise the need for household data which is broken down by different household types. However, none of the reports specify how, in practice, the accounts should be used. This article uses the micro-macro linkage of wealth and income accounts and thus creates a set of macroeconomic wealth accounts broken down by household groups, using micro data available at the national level. The aim of the project is to derive a framework where indebtedness indicators can be optimally estimated in a timely manner and at a quarterly frequency. This article makes the first attempt to estimate annual time series by using historic micro-macro linkage and highlights problems related to time series estimation and suggests how these estimations could be developed further.},

Using the ECB's Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS), we document that the aggregate homeownership rate and various measures of wealth inequality are negatively correlated across Euro Area countries. Empirically, this relationship is driven by the fact that in countries with lower homeownership rates a larger fraction of households only hold very low amounts of wealth. We show that a simple wedge in the rental market can explain the qualitative features of the data using a generalequilibrium life-cycle model of household investment and consumption. A larger wedge incentivizes households to save more at a young age in order to make a downpayment and buy a house. This leads not only to a higher homeownership rate but also overall fewer households with low wealth, decreasing crosssectional wealth inequality. Quantitatively, our model explains 54\% of the variation in wealth inequality seen in the data. We show that the welfare losses associated with the rental market wedges identified by our model can be substantial.},

I examine two episodes over the last four decades in Spain by combining fiscal data with household surveys and national accounts to reconstruct the entire wealth distribution. I then develop a new asset-specific decomposition of wealth accumulation that makes it possible to disentangle the importance of differences in rates of return, savings, labor incomes and portfolio choices across wealth groups in explaining wealth inequality dynamics. My analysis documents that top wealth holders time better the market, saving a larger share on housing during booms and reshuffling their portfolio away from housing towards financial assets at the beginning of busts. Counterfactual simulations show that portfolio reshuffling among top wealth holders is the only channel that contributed to reducing the bottom 50\% wealth share during the recent housing bust. Finally, I document that this heterogeneity in portfolio choices is consistent with the existence of large differences in portfolio adjustment frictions across wealth groups, mainly coming through differences in the composition of housing. Taken together, these results reveal that portfolio reshuffling among top wealth holders is an important driver of short to medium term fluctuations of wealth inequality.},

Observations coming from countries of the world, or regions within one country or continent, are more likely than not to be correlated in the cross section either by some spatial process, or the effect of common factors. The chapter further explores two issues due to the time series dimension of ``long'' panel datasets: nonstationarity and cointegration. Long panels allow to estimate separate regressions for each unit. Hence, it is natural to question the assumption of parameter homogeneity as opposed to various kinds of heterogeneous specifications. The heterogeneous model is usually a generalization of the homogeneous one so that estimating it may allow to test for the validity of the pooling restriction.},

Adopting an influence function regression approach, the paper calculates the counterfactual effects of small increases in the share of recipients of different-sized wealth transfers in each country. Results suggest that while a marginal increase in inheritance recipients generally contracts wealth inequality measures---confirming a common finding in the literature that inter-generational transfers tend to reduce relative wealth inequality---an increase in recipients of `large' inheritances has the opposite effect. We determine what `large' means in this context by point-estimating the thresholds above which transfers become disequalising. We find that transfers above the ninety-fifth percentile of the national transfer distribution are generally associated with an increasing effect on wealth inequality. Such thresholds are then put in perspective against the inheritance tax schedules in place in the six countries analyzed. No unique pattern emerges. While the thresholds are very close to tax exemption thresholds in Britain and Germany, they are somewhat higher in France and Spain and they are much lower in Italy and the United States.},

Specifically, this article revisits, 35~years on and against the onset of financialized capitalism, Jim Kemeny's seminal thesis on the relationship between homeownership and welfare. Focusing on Australia, as a less considered case in the liberal Anglophone cluster, it traces how the state actively overhauled the local post-war homeownership-welfare dynamic from the late 1970s. The analysis establishes how this refurbishment outdates Kemeny's thesis by rendering features of the post-war homeownership model ineffective and, more significantly, by fashioning new homeowner subjectivities---namely, the investor subject. By bringing together Foucauldian perspectives (mortgage biopolitics) with Marxian political economy, this state-sensitive account both responds to Kemeny's unexpected silence on the active hand of the Australian state in structuring its homeownership-welfare dynamic, and contributes to the asset-based welfare critique by emphasizing its post-1980s features and the structural drivers that explain its persistence, despite its unequal wealth and welfare outcomes.},

This paper uses data from household wealth surveys for six rich countries -- Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the US -- to assess the contribution of intergenerational wealth transfers to wealth inequality using decomposition methods for the Gini coefficient. The results show that transfer wealth is consistently a good deal more unequally distributed than non-transfer wealth and total wealth. Transfer wealth accounts for only about one-tenth of overall wealth inequality for the US compared to one-third for Germany and Italy. This mirrors the importance of transfer wealth in total wealth in each country, with differences in inequality in transfer wealth and its correlation with total wealth having only a modest impact. We find that a marginal percentage increase in all transfers reduces total wealth inequality in Britain, Germany and the US, while it would increase total wealth inequality in France, Italy and Spain.},

  abstract = {Comparative research on income inequality has produced several frameworks to study the institutional determinants of income stratification. In contrast, no such framework and much less empirical evidence exist to explain cross-national differences in wealth inequality. This situation is particularly lamentable as cross-national patterns of inequality in wealth diverge sharply from those in income. We seek to pave the way for new explanations of cross-national differences in wealth inequality by tracing them to the influence of different wealth components. Drawing on the literatures on financialization and housing, we argue that housing equity should be the central building block of the comparative analysis of wealth inequality. Using harmonized data on 15 countries included in the Luxembourg Wealth Study (LWS), we demonstrate a lack of association between national levels of income and wealth inequality and concentration. Using decomposition approaches, we then estimate the degree to which national levels of wealth inequality and concentration relate to cross-national differences in wealth portfolios and the distribution of specific asset components. Considering the role of housing equity, financial assets, non-housing real assets, and non-housing debt, we show that cross-national variation in wealth inequality and concentration is centrally determined by the distribution of housing equity.},

We address this question using 1970--2010 national balance sheets recently compiled in the top eight developed economies. For the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and France, we are able to extend our analysis as far back as 1700. We find in every country a gradual rise` of wealth-income ratios in recent decades, from about 200--300\% in 1970 to 400--600\% in 2010. In effect, today's ratios appear to be returning to the high values observed in Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (600--700\%). This can be explained by a long-run asset price recovery (itself driven by changes in capital policies since the world wars) and by the slowdown of productivity and population growth, in line with the {$\beta$}=sg Harrod-Domar-Solow formula. That is, for a given net saving rate s = 10\%, the long-run wealth-income ratio {$\beta$} is about 300\% if g = 3\% and 600\% if g = 1.5\%. Our results have implications for capital taxation and regulation and shed new light on the changing nature of wealth, the shape of the production function, and the rise of capital shares.},

Our distributional national accounts capture 100\% of national income, allowing us to compute growth rates for each quantile of the income distribution consistent with macroeconomic growth. We estimate the distribution of both pretax and posttax income, making it possible to provide a comprehensive view of how government redistribution affects inequality. Average pretax real national income per adult has increased 60\% from 1980 to 2014, but we find that it has stagnated for the bottom 50\% of the distribution at about \$16,000 a year. The pretax income of the middle class---adults between the median and the 90th percentile---has grown 40\% since 1980, faster than what tax and survey data suggest, due in particular to the rise of tax-exempt fringe benefits. Income has boomed at the top. The upsurge of top incomes was first a labor income phenomenon but has mostly been a capital income phenomenon since 2000. The government has offset only a small fraction of the increase in inequality. The reduction of the gender gap in earnings has mitigated the increase in inequality among adults, but the share of women falls steeply as one moves up the labor income distribution, and is only 11\% in the top 0.1\% in 2014.},

We argue that steep progressive income and estate taxation may have prevented large fortunes from fully recovering from these shocks. Top wage shares were flat before World War II, dropped precipitously during the war, and did not start to recover before the late 1960s but are now higher than before World War II.

We find that wealth concentration was high in the beginning of the twentieth century, fell from 1929 to 1978, and has continuously increased since then. The top 0.1\% wealth share has risen from 7\% in 1978 to 22\% in 2012, a level almost as high as in 1929. Top wealth-holders are younger today than in the 1960s and earn a higher fraction of the economy's labor income. The bottom 90\% wealth share first increased up to the mid-1980s and then steadily declined. The increase in wealth inequality in recent decades is due to the upsurge of top incomes combined with an increase in saving rate inequality. We explain how our findings can be reconciled with Survey of Consumer Finances and estate tax data.},

We find that younger households' participation decisions in assets are more responsive to income than older households. Family structure plays a significant role in explaining cross-country differences for both cohorts. Examining institutional differences, we find that in more financially developed and economically open countries, households are less likely to own housing but more likely to be in debt. Typical mortgage characteristics and mathematical literacy are also correlated with debt participation across countries. These findings have important implications for policy setting during times of financial unease for the young, as well as for the future in helping secure adequate income for the elderly. Our results show that there is scope for policies which promote asset participation for young households and debt participation, where there is a need for consumption smoothing, for older households.},

Our model features households' dynamic renting and owning choices, investors' housing portfolio rebalancing, and equilibrium pricing across housing products via a market clearing condition. We recover households' willingness to pay for housing quality and moving costs across the income distribution. Our counterfactuals quantify the regressive effects of tighter loan-to-income (LTI) limits, and document how these depend on household preferences and can be offset limiting investors' real estate trading.},

  abstract = {Housing wealth is the largest source of household wealth, but we know little about the distribution of housing wealth and how institutions have shaped this distribution. Subsidies for homeownership, privatisation of social housing and mortgage finance liberalisation are likely to have influenced the distribution of housing wealth in recent decades. To examine their impact, we describe housing wealth inequalities across occupational classes for two birth cohorts aged fifty and older. The analysis is conducted across 16 European countries with divergent welfare states and housing systems using the fourth wave of the survey of health, ageing and retirement in Europe (SHARE; 2011/2012). Our results indicate that the expansion of homeownership in a market-based housing system is associated with a more unequal distribution of housing wealth across occupational classes, as an increasing number of `marginal' owners are drawn into precarious homeownership. Such a pattern is not found in housing wealth accumulation regimes with a less market-based provision of housing. When the state or the family drive homeownership expansion, a de-coupling of labour market income and housing consumption results in a more equal distribution of housing wealth.},

  abstract = {Previous research consistently shows that homeowners accumulate more wealth compared with tenants. In this paper, we describe the size of this `tenure wealth gap' for 10 European countries. Furthermore, we explain why the size of the tenure wealth gap differs between countries by including cross-level interactions between institutional variables and housing tenure in a series of country-fixed effects regression models. Cross-country differences arise as the costs of owning versus renting, as well as the profitability of homeownership versus other investments, differ along the lines of welfare policies and housing regime arrangements. We attempt to control for selection bias related to tenure status by using propensity score matching techniques, using data from the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS). Our findings suggest that the tenure wealth gap is largest in familialistic welfare states, in which marginalised tenants are unable to save, whereas homeownership is a family resource that provides an in-kind retirement income (`passive' asset-based welfare). We find smaller tenure wealth gaps in countries with a financialised promotion of homeownership, where housing wealth functions as a privatised welfare arrangement (`active' asset-based welfare). The smallest tenure wealth gaps occur in countries with more affordable rental housing, allowing tenants to accumulate savings.},

  abstract = {Recent work on wealth inequality using the capitalization method wherein aggregate wealth totals are distributed proportionately to property income like dividends motivates concern about whether rates of return on assets vary across the income or wealth distribution. Here I use accrued capital gains and imputed rent on homes estimated from the Survey of Consumer Finances to address this issue. Both capital gains and imputed rent form part of total income. I find strong econometric evidence that returns vary directly with wealth level and are considerably higher for very wealthy compared to poorer households. However, I do not find evidence that higher income households receive higher returns once controlling for overall market house price trends. Returns are also strongly related to overall market house price movements, suggesting that timing the market is a key determinant. However, paradoxically, adding housing returns to baseline household wealth reduces overall wealth inequality.},

The most telling finding is that median wealth plummeted by 44 percent between 2007 and 2010, almost double the drop in housing prices. Wealth inequality, after almost two decades of little movement, was up sharply from 2007 to 2010. This sharp fall in median net worth and rise in overall wealth inequality are traceable primarily to the high leverage of middle-class families, the high share of homes in their portfolio, and the plunge in house prices. Rather remarkably, median (and mean) wealth did not essentially change from 2010 to 2013 despite the rebound in asset prices. The proximate cause was the high dissavings of the middle class. Wealth inequality also remained largely unchanged.},

  abstract = {Clustered covariances or clustered standard errors are very widely used to account for correlated or clustered data, especially in economics, political sciences, and other social sciences. They are employed to adjust the inference following estimation of a standard least-squares regression or generalized linear model estimated by maximum likelihood. Although many publications just refer to "the" clustered standard errors, there is a surprisingly wide variety of clustered covariances, particularly due to different flavors of bias corrections. Furthermore, while the linear regression model is certainly the most important application case, the same strategies can be employed in more general models (e.g., for zero-inflated, censored, or limited responses). In R, functions for covariances in clustered or panel models have been somewhat scattered or available only for certain modeling functions, notably the (generalized) linear regression model. In contrast, an object-oriented approach to "robust" covariance matrix estimation  -  applicable beyond lm() and glm()  -  is available in the sandwich package but has been limited to the case of cross-section or time series data. Starting with sandwich 2.4.0, this shortcoming has been corrected: Based on methods for two generic functions (estfun() and bread()), clustered and panel covariances are provided in vcovCL(), vcovPL(), and vcovPC(). Moreover, clustered bootstrap covariances are provided in vcovBS(), using model update() on bootstrap samples. These are directly applicable to models from packages including MASS, pscl, countreg, and betareg, among many others. Some empirical illustrations are provided as well as an assessment of the methods' performance in a simulation study.},
