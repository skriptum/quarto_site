Nestled in the heart of Thuringia, the German district of Sonneberg made headlines with a historic moment – it became the first constituency to elect a district administrator from the right wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. In an unexpected turn, Robert Sesselmann of the AfD won a closely contested run-off election against the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), securing 52.8% of the votes. The results not only marked a seismic shift in local politics but sent shockwaves through the established political order [@schuetzeFirstGermanyFar2023]. It exemplifies the growing right-wing populism which has been spreading in Germany and elsewhere over the last few decades.

Intriguingly, Sonneberg also holds the distinction of having the highest percentage of minimum wage workers in Germany – 44%. This paper aims to explore the connection between minimum wage recipiency and the support for right-wing populist movements, using Sonneberg as a focal point. Employing data from the WSI and the German Federal Election Officer in an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, the findings reveals a significant correlation between these variables, even when accounting for other relevant controls.

## Data


The analysis is based on data compiled by @puschMindestlohn12Euro2022 at the Institute of Economic and Social Sciences (WSI). They provide an estimate of the share of workers in a given district who will be affected by the increase in the minimum wage to €12 in October 2022 (henceforth minimum wage workers). 

Alternative for Germany (AfD) results from the federal election on the 26.10.2021 are from the Federal Election Commissioner (@diebundeswahlleiterinBundestagswahl2021Endgultiges2021). Elections in Germany take place in constituencies (Wahlkreise), which are different from the standard counties (Landkreise). Therefore, the data is transformed by the election office, which does not lead to any losses.

Additional data on socio-economic and socio-demographic factors are provided by the regional statistical offices of the Länder. Most of these data are for the year 2022, with the exception of population density estimates, for which more recent data are not yet available.
