There is a new LaTeX contender on the block: [typst](typst.app). Featuring a much easier syntax and instant-preview, it feels like a serious replacement for the clunky workflows of producing PDF via `\{weird command}`. What was missing until now is an easy way to create good looking slides, the existing packages in the typst ecosystem are overblown for the quick creation of presentations.

I totally get it. That's why I created Diatypst, a package that makes it a breeze to create stunning slides without having to memorize complicated commands or settle for dull styling. The slides are set up to make your life easier, with a dot counter in the upper left corner (like the one in Beamer) and helpful defaults for title and section slides. Hey, just so you know, you can set a color that'll influence everything from the page footer to the hyperlinks. 

There are two different themes available, the normal theme and the full theme. The latter one is more like a fully-fledged beamer theme that's used a lot in academia.

| Normal Theme                                                 | Full Theme                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ![Example-Slide](./Example-Slide.png)                        | ![Full-Example-Slide](./Full-Example-Slide.png)              |
| Example [.typ file](https://github.com/skriptum/diatypst/blob/main/example/example.typ) and the [resulting PDF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skriptum/diatypst/refs/heads/main/example/example.pdf) | same for the [Full Theme PDF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skriptum/diatypst/refs/heads/main/example/example_full.pdf) |

### How to get started?

The easiest way to use diatypst is via the [Typst Webapp](https://typst.app) and importing the template from the [typst universe](https://typst.app/universe/package/diatypst/). To create new slides, just delimit them with a header and they are created automatically. For more fine-tuning, visit the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/skriptum/diatypst).

Another option is to use [Quarto](quarto.org) to create the slides. To do this, you need to import the [diaquarto extension](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/listing-formats.html) into your project and some things in your YAML Footer. Slides are created similar to beamer presentations with the `---` delimiter. For more info, see [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skriptum/diatypst/refs/heads/main/example/example_full.pdf)

### What does diatypst stand for?

The word diatypst is inspired by the ease of use of a [Diaprojektor](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaprojektor) (German for Slide Projector) and the [Diatype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatype_(machine)) (60s typesetting machine)
