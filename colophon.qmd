This website is built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org), a modern system to create Websites, Articles, PDFs or Presentations from [Markdown](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

It uses a custom scss theme to overcome the boring standard theme. The complete code for the website can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/skriptum/quarto_site). I have added some extra tricks, but in the end its just markdown.

Some SEO tricks are taken from the must-read [Guide to Academic Websites by Hendrik Erz](https://www.hendrik-erz.de/resources#academic-website).
